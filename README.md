# pathway-snippets
- A few code snippets for LA Pathways, a project I worked on for the City of LA. 
- LA Pathways is a web platform used to connect aspiring entrepreneurs and business owners in the City of LA  with specialized coaches and mentors to help improve and/or establish their business. The site was built on a SaaS platform using React, Node, .NET, and SQL, implemented RESTful APIs, and  integrated Bootstrap/jQuery themes.
